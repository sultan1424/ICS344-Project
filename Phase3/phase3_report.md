# Phase 3: Defensive Strategy Proposal

---

## 1. Introduction

In Phase 3 of the project, we implemented a defensive strategy to protect the SSH service on the Metasploitable3 victim machine. After successfully exploiting SSH vulnerabilities in Phase 1 and visualizing the attacks in Phase 2, the goal of this phase was to harden the system and prevent unauthorized access or successful brute-force attacks.

---

## 2. Selected Defensive Mechanism

To secure the SSH service, we applied two layers of defense:

- **SSH Configuration Hardening:**
  - Disabled password-based authentication (`PasswordAuthentication no`)
  - Disabled root login (`PermitRootLogin no`)

- **Network Firewall (UFW) Restriction:**
  - Allowed SSH access only from the Kali Linux attacker's IP (`192.168.8.166`)
  - Blocked all other incoming connections by default (`ufw default deny incoming`)

This dual approach ensured that even if a connection reached the server, it would still be blocked unless it used proper authentication mechanisms.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Harden SSH Configuration

- Edited the SSH server configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
- Applied the following settings:

  ```bash
  PermitRootLogin no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```

- Restarted the SSH service to apply changes:

  ```bash
  sudo service ssh restart
  ```

### 3.2 Configure UFW Firewall

- Installed UFW (already installed).
- Allowed only the Kali attacker's IP to access SSH:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow from 192.168.8.166 to any port 22 proto tcp
  ```

- Denied all other incoming traffic:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw status
  ```

## 4. Testing and Validation

After applying the defense mechanisms, we reran the attack scenarios:

### 4.1 SSH Login Attempt

- Attempted SSH login manually from Kali Linux:
  
  ```bash
  ssh vagrant@192.168.8.165
  ```

- Result: **Permission denied (publickey)** error, confirming password login is disabled.

---

### 4.2 Brute-Force Attempt Using Hydra

- Attempted a brute-force attack using Hydra tool:

  ```bash
  hydra -l vagrant -P smalllist.txt ssh://192.168.8.165
  ```

- Result: Attack failed because password authentication was not available.

## 5. Before and After Comparison

| Aspect | Before Defense | After Defense |
|:---|:---|:---|
| SSH Access | Open to any IP | Restricted to 192.168.8.166 (Kali only) |
| Authentication | Password login allowed | Password login disabled |
| Firewall Protection | No firewall rules | UFW rules applied |
| Attack Success | Successful brute-force attack | All login attempts fail |
| Risk Level | High (vulnerable) | Very Low (hardened) |

## 6. Conclusion

Through the implementation of SSH configuration hardening and strict firewall rules, we successfully mitigated the previous vulnerabilities exploited in Phase 1. By disabling password authentication and limiting SSH access to a specific IP address, the system is now significantly more secure against unauthorized access and brute-force attacks.

## 7. Commands Used

Below are all the commands executed during the defense setup:

### SSH Configuration Hardening

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Edited:
#   PermitRootLogin no
#   PasswordAuthentication no

sudo service ssh restart
```

### UFW Firewall Configuration

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ufw
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.8.166 to any port 22 proto tcp
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

### Attack Validation (Testing)

```bash
ssh vagrant@192.168.8.165
hydra -l vagrant -P smalllist.txt ssh://192.168.8.165
```
