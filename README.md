## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the ICS344 course and focuses on penetration testing, security analysis, and defensive strategies using a vulnerable service on Metasploitable3.

The project is divided into three main phases:
- **Phase 1:** Setup and Compromise of the Vulnerable Service
- **Phase 2:** Attack Visualization through SIEM Dashboard
- **Phase 3:** Implementation of Defensive Mechanisms

Each phase includes detailed steps, screenshots, and documentation for better clarity and assessment.
